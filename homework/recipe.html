    <h1>Curry Udon</h1>
        <ul>Curry Udon has been a popular menu item in Japan for a long time. 
            It is lesser-known compared to Curry Rice, but the creamy curry is just as fulfilling when you enjoy it with udon.</ul>

    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Your choice of protein</strong></li>
                <ul> -I used thinly sliced pork loin in the recipe as it cooks in seconds, but feel free to use your choice of protein such as chicken, beef, seafood, or tofu.</ul>

            <li><strong>Green onion</strong></li>

            <li><strong>Dashi (Japanese soup stock)</strong></li> 
                <ul>– homemade, which takes just 30 minutes, or dashi packet, or dashi powder).</ul>

                <ul>– More about it below.</ul>
        </ul>
    
    <h1>Procedure</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Make dashi.</li> 
        <li>Stir fry the onion and your choice of protein in the frying pan.</li> 
        <li>Add the dashi and curry roux in the frying pan.</li>
        <li>Cook up udon noodles in a separate pot.</li>
        <li>Assemble drained udon noodles and curry soup in a serving bowl. </li>     
    </ol>
         <ul>A satisfying noodle dish whipped up in under 30 minutes! This curry udon is rich and flavorful, with just a tinge of sweetness in each spoonful. </ul>

     <h1>What is Japanese Curry Roux</h1>    
        <ul>Since the Japanese modify the food from other cuisines to suit their palate, you can expect Japanese curry to be quite different from Indian curries or Thai curries. It is thicker, milder, and sweeter, with a stew-like consistency. An ideal curry for curry beginners, or for people who prefer a gentler, sweeter flavor.</ul>
        <ul>To make the curry soup, we’ll need to make curry roux. Homemade curry roux from scratch is, of course, the best, but there’s always an option of using the convenient store-bought curry roux when needed.</ul>
        <ul>This is going to be a quick curry recipe, so I take the easy route this time. Nowadays, you can even find the rectangular packages of Japanese Curry Roux sold at major American grocery stores. Look for them at the Asian/ global food aisle. </ul>

     <h1>Which Udon Noodles to Pick?</h1>   
        <ul>Thick, chewy, slippery udon noodles are so delicious! You can buy frozen, refrigerated, or dried udon noodles at Japanese or Asian grocery stores, and refrigerated ones in American grocery stores.</ul>
